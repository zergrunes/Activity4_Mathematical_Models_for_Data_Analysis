Marian Remoroza - Activity 4
Design one data analytics model that uses “advanced” mathematical, statistical, visualization, or machine learning model. The following are suggested “general” cases. Each group performs a real-world data analysis (may use dataset from previous assignments or find a new dataset) that may fit one of the following cases.

    Case 1: more meaningful information can be generated from data analysis if mathematical and/or statistical model is used, e.g. score analysis => standard deviation, outliers or missing data analysis, correlation, …
    Case 2: more meaningful or clearer information can be generated from data analysis if advanced visualization techniques are used, e.g. Covid-19 data analysis => worldwide status on map
    Case 3: more meaningful information can be generated if machine learning is used. Implementation not required, e.g. coin sorting => clustering problem
